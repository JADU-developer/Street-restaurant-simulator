This game was built using free-to-use assets and royalty-free music and sound effects. I do not claim ownership of these external resources.

As a programmer, I wrote most of the code myself. I did use AI tools to speed up certain repetitive tasks, but the core logic, gameplay mechanics, and polish were all handcrafted by me.

There may be a few spelling errors, but in the race against the jam deadline, I prioritized gameplay over grammar.
